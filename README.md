This is a set of McStas components and instruments to model a Triple-Axis and a Time-Of-Flight neutron scattering instruments, connected with a [Lego MindStorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT) real-world model. 

This is a robotic model (it moves) to be used for teaching/training and in exhibitions. When a McStas simulation is launched on the PC, the model positions itself with the corresponding geometry.
